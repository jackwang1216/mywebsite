# About Jack Wang

## Personal Background

I was born in Japan and spent my early childhood in both Osaka and Shanghai, where I learned to speak fluent Japanese and Mandarin. Growing up in Shanghai, life wasn't easy—my mom raised me alone, often with limited resources. Moving to the United States at age 10 marked a significant turning point in my life, presenting both challenges and opportunities.

Initially, adapting to a new culture was tough, but soccer quickly became my bridge to connecting with others. I played competitively and excelled on my club team in Iowa, though eventually, setbacks and team dynamics led me to lose some of my passion for the sport.

Throughout these formative years, my experiences shaped a deep sense of responsibility toward my family, especially my mom. This motivates me academically and professionally as I pursue my education in Mathematics and Computer Science at MIT, and explore fields like AI, software engineering, and quantitative modeling. My ultimate goal is to build a meaningful career that allows me to support my mother and give back to others facing similar challenges.

## Professional Philosophy

My philosophy in general is very simple: Work hard. When you feel burnt out, work harder (unless you don't have work). When you feel tired, work harder. When you feel like you are 95% done, work harder. I think everyone can do anything (maybe except getting a girlfriend for me—my DMs are open!).

## Technical Interests

As of right now, I am unsure of what I want to do long-term. I sometimes get tired of coding the more I do it, so maybe the finance world is for me. You never know though, especially since I do think the startup world is cool if the idea is interesting and impactful.

## Personal Interests

I am on the Men's varsity track and field team here at MIT. I also love to play soccer—I used to be in the Chinese national youth soccer program before moving to the USA. I hate school but I love learning.

## Values

Taking care of my mother is my top priority. Also, my dog is my best friend.

## Favorite Algorithms and Technical Preferences

My favorite algorithm is Graph duplication with Bellman Ford. I find this algorithm particularly interesting because it efficiently solves the single-source shortest path problem even with negative edge weights. The combination of graph traversal with dynamic programming makes it both powerful and elegant. When someone asks about my favorite algorithms, Bellman Ford is definitely at the top of my list.
